# Overview
This is a simple game for Harvard's CS50xs final project that I made to learn some game development. It's not much and I probably couldn't have done it without help from the communities and referencing some distribution code, but it's a start.
## Description
You play as a ninja that has to run to the end of a randomly generated level. You have to avoid pits and spikes. Once you reach the end, you will replenish you lifes, get 500 points, and start a new level all over again. The goal is simply to gain as many points as possible. The game is easy, doesn't get harder, and is just a bit of silly fun.
You can attack, but there aren't any enemies. There are a few randomly generated things like pyramids, holes and spikes (well those are the only things really) to make things just a slight bit more interesting.
It could possibly be made into something more complex with enemies, more structures, and levels that progressively get harder, but for now this is all I can manage for now.
Running this game requires Love 2D to be installed. From there navigate to the directory where main is and run.
```bash
"C:/Program files/Love/love.exe" "."
```
